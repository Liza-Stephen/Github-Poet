Travelers far and beyond bear the stories of your beauty, 
the bride veiled by lofty snow-capped mountains and crowned with the springs of Kupwara. 
They speak wistfully of the serenity of Sufis embroidered with Zari into your poised meadows and woods; 
the sprinkle of flowers, scented with laughter shrouded by your Taranga, tucked into Gulmarg; 
and your untameable wild flaunted in the strides of the snow leopard in the quiet of Hemis. 
They are smitten by your unabated beauty 
but the legacy of your loversâ€™ fight taints your allure and so they bid farewell 
and when the memory strikes, they boil kahwah and let the saffron and cinnamon hum an ode.
